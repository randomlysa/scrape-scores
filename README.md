# Scrape Scores

Cleverly named project to scrape scores off a website and convert to a traditionally used 'standings' table with sorting by 
record, W/L, Home/Away Record, PPG, OPP PPG, win streak, and home/away total points scored.

Uses in memory JS SQL (AlaSQL), a cached node server, and caching on localhost for faster reloading.

Can probably be seen at http://code.randomlysa.com/scrape-scores/ assuming the original page still exists with data.
